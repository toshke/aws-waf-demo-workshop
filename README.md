# AWS WAF Workshop

This workshop provides hands on experience with
- Deploying Serverless API Endpoint using api gateway
- Load testing HTTPS API Endpoint using goad utility and coker
- Deploying WebApplicationFirewall (WAF) to protect the serverless api endpoint
- Demonstrate the WAF request blocking functionality based
on header

## Prereqs


This workshop makes assumptions on students running it using [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) in `us-east-2` region. You may be able to run from Mac
or Windows as well, and in other regions, though workshop steps are not optimised for such environment.

Also, all of the step instructions are relying
on the fact that you are positioned within that steps
folder.

Cloud9 instance should have IAM Role with following permissions attached to it
 - Manage CloudForamtion resources
 - Manage AWS Lambda functions
 - Manage API Gateway
 - Manage CloudWatch resources
 - Manage WAF Regional resources

For the simplicity of the workshop conduction, it is
recommended to have admin priveleges credentials

You can find [instructions here on how to setup Cloud9](cloud9.md)
